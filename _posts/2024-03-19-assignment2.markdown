## Time series vs Bar chart
Should we use a time series or a bar chart? Maybe a bar chart here and then we could maybe have a time series plot as the interactive plot (the final plot).

This is a time series:

![Time-series]({{ page.time-series}}){:width="100%"}

This is a bar chart:
![Bar-chart]({{ page.bar-chart}}){:width="100%"}

## Map plot

This is a map plot:

<iframe src="{{page.plotly}}" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support iframes.
</iframe>
