This is a website created as part of **Week 7** exercise in the course 02806 Social Data and Analysis at DTU. It will be used to host the web-page (story) created as part of **Week 8** exercise, which is subsequently also **Assignment 2**.

It also hosts the final project of the course, which dives into the Icelandic housing market and explores trends and fun insights. Enjoy!
